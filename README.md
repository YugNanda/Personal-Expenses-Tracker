# Personal-Expenses-Tracker 
Hereâ€™s a simple Python project idea: A Personal Expense Tracker.

This project allows users to:

Add expenses with a description, amount, and date.

View all recorded expenses.

Get the total amount spent.

Save and load data using a CSV file.

How This Works

1. Adding an Expense: You enter a description, amount, and date, which is saved in a CSV file.


2. Viewing Expenses: The program reads and displays all expenses from the CSV file.


3. Total Expense Calculation: It sums up all expenses and shows the total amount spent.


4. Persistent Data: Expenses are saved in a file (expenses.csv), so they remain even after restarting the program.



This is a beginner-friendly project that also helps in learning file handling, loops, and functions in Python.
